Although the exemption was formally abolished in 2008, condensate has remained subject to a lower rate of excise than that applied to fields discovered prior to September 1975, which is the Treasury benchmark for crude-oil excise.

In practice, oil and gas and mining companies investing in the exploration and development of mineral resources in Canada were able to claim depletion allowances in addition to other available deductions such as those for Canadian Exploration Expense and Canadian Development Expense, thereby obtaining overall deductions in excess of the total amounts actually spent on exploration and development (e.g. for as much as 133% of these amounts).

In his budget speech, the Finance Minister announced the government will phase out the accelerated capital cost allowance which allows oil sands producers to quickly write off the cost of their investment for income tax purposes. The tax break was introduced by the Liberal government in 1996, when oil prices were low, in an effort to stimulate investment in the vast tar sands of northeastern Alberta. But with the crude price now hovering around $60 (U.S.), the Conservative government decided the tax break was no longer necessary. Instead, it will be phasing in an accelerated capital cost allowance to promote investments in greener technologies, including so-called carbon capture and storage projects that would capture the greenhouse gas emissions from projects like the oil sands, and then bury those gases underground. To soften the blow to the oil industry, Mr. Flaherty said that any major project that commenced construction prior to budget day will be grandfathered, and the companies' capital spending will still qualify for accelerated write-offs. For the several multi-billion dollar projects that have been approved but construction has not yet started, companies will be eligible for accelerated write-offs until 2010, and then the rate will be reduced to the normal capital cost allowance by 2015. Finance officials estimated that the tax break could cost Ottawa some $300-million a year, depending on construction activity in the oil sands. The change will not boost federal revenues until after 2010, at the earliest.","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/oil-sands-tax-break-to-end----in-2010/article17993063/","http://michaelchong.ca/2015/03/25/reducing-emissions-in-canada-by-eliminating-oil-sands-subsidies/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2010-01-01,2010-01-01

China has made significant progress in bringing domestic energy prices closer to global market levels and is continuing to push ahead with new reforms. These efforts have contributed to the significant reduction in energy intensity experienced since 1980. Prices for crude oil produced in China are already determined on the basis of the price for comparable grades of oil sold in international markets. Prices for many refined oil products also now generally match the international levels. In 2007, China lifted its remaining price controls for coal and began to introduce a market-based pricing system. Coal prices for power generations are now largely set by direct negotiations between coal producers and power companies. In the natural gas market, prices remain relatively low compared to those on international market. In May 2010, the government announced a 25% increase in onshore natural has benchmark prices following an increase in gas transmission fees. The increase should induce consumers to use gas more efficiently, and should accelerate investment in China's national oil companies in domestic exploration and production and development of LNG and long-distance pipeline gas import projects. After launching a programme to eliminate the preferential tariff arrangements for certain energy-intensive industries and increase the electricity prices for non-residential users in 2009, the government has recently released a proposal to introduce a tiered electricity pricing mechanism for residents (under which prices would increase with consumption).","https://www.iea.org/media/weowebsite/energysubsidies/second_joint_report.pdf","http://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-watch-blog/new-narrative-climate-talks-cutting-emissions-both-arms-scissors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2010-01-01,2010-01-01

The original exemption was for a five-year period, starting at the beginning of the non-resident company’s 2005/06 financial year and ending on 31 December 2009. The exemption was, however, subsequently extended twice to end on 31 December 2019. Eligible exploration and development activities are defined as the operation of a ship to provide seismic survey readings or the drilling of an exploratory well or other well. These activities must be undertaken for the purposes of identifying and developing exploitable petroleum deposits or occurrences in an offshore permit area. This particular provision was introduced as part of the package announced in June 2004 to boost natural-gas exploration in response to the downward revision of the Maui field in the early 2000s. Prior to this, non-resident drilling-rig operators and seismic-ship operators were taxed on their income derived from New Zealand operations from the first day of their presence in New Zealand, the same as non-residence operators undertaking other activities. The change means that non-resident offshore rig operators and non-resident operators of seismic survey ships have been exempt from paying company tax on their profits in New Zealand from 2004. The reason for targeting only non-residents is that only non-residents currently provide the types of services covered by the exemption. The New Zealand Government has concluded that the measure has no fiscal impact since a removal of the income-tax exemption would lead to a higher expenditure for the applicable operators, and in turn reduce their taxable income. This is, for instance, because a non-resident drilling-rig operator would replace the operating rig with a new one as soon as tax would be due (after 183 days of stay in New Zealand), a practice known as rig churning.","OECD (2020), ""OECD Inventory of Support Measures for Fossil Fuels: New Zealand"", OECD Environment Statistics (database), https://doi.org/10.1787/b104b066-en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2019-01-01,2019-01-01

Another key reform the Thailand government implemented was the removal of Certified Natural Gas (CNG) subsidies as CNG was heavily subsidized. During 2014 and 2015, the government raised the price of CNG by around 4% to 10% and eventually floated the price in 2016. As an outcome, the CNG price is at par with the market price, which fell to around 12.55 baht or USD 0.36 in January 2017.","https://www.climatescorecard.org/2018/01/thailand-subsidies/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2014-01-01,2014-01-01

According to HM Revenue & Customs (2008), it was the largest cross-field measure before its repeal.

It allows for a certain proportion of oil to be earned free of PRT for at least the first ten years of production (longer period if there are sufficient profits to absorb all of the available deductions). The value of the allowance itself is determined using a statutory formula that depends in part on the date at which the field was developed and on its location. The cost of this provision has been declining over time due to the decrease in the production qualified for allowance and to the use up of available allowances. As the rate of PRT was reduced to 0% from January 2016, the amount of the allowance became nil starting since 2016.","OECD (2020), ""OECD Inventory of Support Measures for Fossil Fuels: United Kingdom"", OECD Environment Statistics (database), https://doi.org/10.1787/189ee1ee-en",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2016-01-01,2016-01-01
